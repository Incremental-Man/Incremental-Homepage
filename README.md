- 👋 Hi, I’m @Incremental-Man! Also known as Connor Domotor! The tech-savvy 13 year old!
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and incrementals! I also dabble a bit into arts and music!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make a 2-Dimensional game!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nobody!
- 📫 If you wanna reach to me, you can't!
- 😄 My pronouns are... Well... You can use any of them on me! I won't be offended!
- ⚡ A little fact about me: I made a previous game on glitch.com called spaghetti the incremental and well don't play it, it's cringe.

- My favourite incremental games:

  1. Fundamental
  2. Ordinal Markup
  3. Antimatter Dimensions
  4. The Prestige Tree
  5. Distance Incremental
 
Spaghetti the incremental would probably go down to #7 on the list.
